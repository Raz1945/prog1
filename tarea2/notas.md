***Texto:**
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?hola  *--> 1er parrafo* ==> puntero nro 1 
I thought not. Its not a story the Jedi would tell you. *--> 2do parrafo* ==> puntero nro 2 
Its a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, *--> 3er parrafo* ==> puntero nro 3 
so powerful and so wise he could use the Force
to influence the midichlorians to create life...
He had such a knowledge of the dark side that 
he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.
The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities 
some consider to be unnatural.
He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power,
which eventually, of course, he did.
Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, 
then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.
Ironic.
